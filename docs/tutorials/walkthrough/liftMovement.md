# Lift Movement

A large majority of vex games require the use of a lift, and it serves as a 
great example for controlling non-chassis systems. The easiest place to start
with controlling a lift is having it move with joystick buttons, as is common in
a lot of opcontrol code for the subject. The following code snippet shows how
to do this with a [ControllerButton](@ref okapi::ControllerButton):

```cpp
const int LIFT_MOTOR_PORT = 1; // Controlling a lift with a single motor on port 1

ControllerButton btnUp(ControllerDigital::R1);
ControllerButton btnDown(ControllerDigital::R2);
Motor lift(LIFT_MOTOR_PORT);

void opcontrol() {
  while (true) {
    if (btnUp.isPressed()) {
      lift.moveVoltage(12000);
    } else if (btnDown.isPressed()) {
      lift.moveVoltage(-12000);
    } else {
      lift.moveVoltage(0);
    }

    pros::delay(10);
  }
}
```

One improvement that can be made to this lift code would be a switch to using
set heights and a
[position PID controller](@ref okapi::AsyncPosControllerBuilder). This is a
common approach used for stacking games where movement to precise heights is
important.

```cpp
const int LIFT_MOTOR_PORT = 1; // Controlling a lift with a single motor on port 1

const int NUM_HEIGHTS = 4;
const int height1 = 20;
const int height2 = 60;
const int height3 = 100;
const int height4 = 140;

const int heights[NUM_HEIGHTS] = {height1, height2, height3, height4};

ControllerButton btnUp(ControllerDigital::R1);
ControllerButton btnDown(ControllerDigital::R2);
std::shared_ptr<AsyncPositionController<double, double>> liftControl =
  AsyncPosControllerBuilder().withMotor(LIFT_MOTOR_PORT).build();

void opcontrol() {
  int goalHeight = 0;

  while (true) {
    if (btnUp.changedToPressed() && goalHeight < NUM_HEIGHTS - 1) {
      // If the goal height is not at maximum and the up button is pressed, increase the setpoint
      goalHeight++;
      liftControl->setTarget(heights[goalHeight]);
    } else if (btnDown.changedToPressed() && goalHeight > 0) {
      goalHeight--;
      liftControl->setTarget(heights[goalHeight]);
    }

    pros::delay(10);
  }
}
```
