# Tutorials

Learning a new coding platform is often a rather daunting task. For this
reason we prepared some small tutorials with examples on how to interact
with core components of OkapiLib on your VEX V5 system.

The OkapiLib tutorials are split into two sections:

## Walkthrough Tutorials

If you want to write full sample programs to learn to use OkapiLib through
practical applications, or teach students to use OkapiLib in a classroom
environment, the **Walkthrough Tutorials** are a great resource to go step by
step through the process of writing an OkapiLib program.

 - [Clawbot](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/clawbot.md)
 - [Basic Autonomous Movement](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/basicAutonomousMovement.md)
 - [Async Autonomous Movement](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/asyncAutonomousMovement.md)
 - [Lift Movement](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/liftMovement.md)
 - [Chassis Controller Builder](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/chassisControllerBuilder.md)
 - [Odometry](docs/tutorials/walkthrough/odometry.md)

## Topical Tutorials

If you want more information about using a particular part of the OkapiLib API
after reading through the API reference, the **Topical Tutorials** offer longer
examples and more detail about using the API.
