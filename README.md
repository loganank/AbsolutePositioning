# OkapiLib

A PROS library for programming VEX V5 robots. This library is intended to raise the floor for teams
with all levels of experience. New teams should have an easier time getting their robot up and
running, and veteran teams should find that OkapiLib doesn't get in the way or place any limits on
functionality.

OkapiLib documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages
[here](https://okapilib.github.io/OkapiLib/index.html).
PROS documentation is hosted on the Purdue site
[here](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5).

## Installing

OkapiLib is installed by default in new projects. If it is not, you can install it using the PROS
CLI. In your terminal, inside the project you want to install OkapiLib in, run `prosv5 conduct apply
